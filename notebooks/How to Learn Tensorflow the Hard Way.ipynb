    "# How to Learn Tensorflow the Hard Way\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started, I was overwhelmed by all the different high-level libraries on top of TensorFlow such as [TF-Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim), [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras), [TF-learn](http://tflearn.org/), and [Tensorflow’s Estimator Class](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators). These libraries contained slightly varying but similar syntax making it hard to follow one example to another. Instead of diving head first into these high-level APIs, I found it valuable to first understand Tensorflow’s low-level API. The learning curve is steeper and not as flashy as implementing [VGG16 in 50 lines](https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3#file-vgg-16_keras-py-L7-L55). But, the payoff is worth your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow becomes much more straight-forward and malleable once you understand a couple key concepts. I will highlight key concepts here, and I hope others jumping into Tensorflow find them useful.\n",

    "**1. [Tensorflow is a dataflow programming framework.](https://medium.com/@ouwenhuang/how-to-learn-tensorflow-the-hard-way-8b34b1e8e173)**\n",

    "# 1. Tensorflow is a dataflow programming framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Dataflow or Datastream programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming), you define and run a computation graph. Each **node** in the graph represents a function such as addition, multiplication, etc. Each **edge** represents the *inputs/outputs* of these functions. Once the computation graph is defined, we can evaluate outputs of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/graph_update.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "*Figure 1: The figure above is an example of a computational graph. Each node {A, B, C, D, E, F} performs some computational operation. {A} will square inputs, {B} will cube inputs, {C} adds one, etc. Each individual node is dependent only on its inputs. The program is created by the way nodes are wired together.\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple **pros** summarized from [Tensorflow’s documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/graphs):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear dependencies**. It is easy to exploit parallelism and distribution across multiple devices (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, Clusters) because Tensorflow node dependencies (input edges) are explicit. A quick glance at our example shows that nodes **{B, C}** can be run in parallel, but **{C, D}** or **{B,D}** cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language agnostic compilation**. A graph can be defined in any language of choice, and compiled by TensorFlow’s [XLA compiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/xla/index) for optimized compute and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the cons?\n",
    "- **Static graph at run time**. Tensorflow requires a *graph* to be predefined before it is run, and once it is running we cannot make changes within that session. In a nutshell, a graph is a network of plumbing pipes and starting a session begins the flow of water. Unfortunately, you cannot move pipes around while water is flowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *As a note, other libraries such as [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) were originally designed to allow dynamic graph execution, but Tensorflow is now adding features for dynamic graph execution ([Tensor Fold](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-fold-deep.html), [Eager Execution](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html)).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataflow just describes an interface, but how does Tensorflow actually implement their dataflow framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/API_layers.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "*Figure 2: Tensorflow’s API implementation which follows a dataflow interface.\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll loosely go through the above diagram from the top to the bottom of our diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use a provided library ([Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python), [GoLang](https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go), [Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/package-summary), and [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc)) which implements the **Graph API**. These libraries help write out a Tensorflow graph in a special format known as [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (we’ll come back to what protobufs are, but for now just think of them as XML, HTML, JSON, or any structuring language).\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries also implement the **Session API** which provides an interface to the Tensorflow C++ Runtime. This runtime is where all the heavy lifting happens. The logic behind each computational node is defined here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tensorflow C++ Runtime will ultimately distribute operations to be executed on the underlying hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, enough theory — [next](https://medium.com/@ouwenhuang/tensorflow-graphs-are-just-protobufs-9df51fc7d08d), we will be focusing on the Tensorflow Python library to create Graphs and then run some Sessions."
